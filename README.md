# discord-embed-bot

1: You have to install: "nodejs", "discord.js", "dotenv", "colors" using npm. Google it for tutorials. 
2: You have to create an file named ".env" in your bot folder with following content:

export {

TOKEN=YOUT_BOT_TOKEN

}

THIS BOT IS WORK IN PROGRESS! You can easily send an embed using:

sendembed [#textchannel] [JSON CODE]

or edit an already existing embed by using:

editembed [#textchannel] [message id] [new json code]

You can get your JSON Code by using: https://embedbuilder.nadekobot.me/ and just copy pasting the code it gives you. NOTICE! When using empty fields you can't leave them empty but have to but: "\u200b" in the field to make it work!

I'm an 15 years old german student so don't expect the best work from me! I try to code some easy discord bots and maby other thnks in the future.
