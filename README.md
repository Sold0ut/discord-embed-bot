1: install "nodejs", "discord.js", "dotenv", "colors" using npm. Google it for tutorials.

2: Create a file named ".env" in the "discord-embed-bot"-folder with following content:

export {

    TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

}

HOW TO GET YOUR BOT TOKEN:

THIS BOT IS WORK IN PROGRESS!
You can easily send an embed using: 

>sendembed [#textchannel] [JSON CODE]

or edit an already existing embed by using: 

>editembed [#textchannel] [message id] [new json code]

You can get your JSON Code by using: https://embedbuilder.nadekobot.me/ and just copy pasting the code it gives you. 

NOTICE! When using empty fields you can't leave them empty but have to but: "\u200b" in the field to make it work!

I'm an 15 years old german student so don't expect the best work from me!
I try to code some easy discord bots and maby other thnks in the future.
